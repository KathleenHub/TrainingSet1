I already use visual studio code and github in my current job as an project engineer to configure our company software to fit the needs of the customer.
We work using agile principles and releaseing a new software version every two weeks.
However I have been thrown into coding to bridge the gap between the developpers and the pharma related customers, 
while i have a phd degree in bioscience engineering specialised in expanding human mesenchymal stem cells.

So in order to advance my knowledge of coding i have followed the CS50x and CSWOw courses thaught on Edx.
I executed the problems shown in the lectures of CS50w here on my github account to have a feeling of writing the code myself.
