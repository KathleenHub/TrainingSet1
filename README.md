I already used visual studio code in my current job as an project engineer to configure our company software to fit the needs of the customer.
However I have been thrown into coding to bridge the gap between the developpers and the pharma related customers, 
while i have a phd degree in bioscience engineering specialised in expanding human mesenchymal stem cells.

So in order to advance my knowledge of coding i am following the CS50x course thaught on Edx.
I watched all lectures and the insights of explaining the "underneath the hood" principles of C are very interesting.
However I'm more interesting to use python and javascript in practice since this relates most to the work im currently doing at my job,
therefore i'm only executing these problemsets here in github
